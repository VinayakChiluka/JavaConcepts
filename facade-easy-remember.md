1. simple interface to a complex system

    Explanation: It helps in reducing the complexity of interactions and dependencies between clients and subsystems. 
By creating a single point of access, it encapsulates the intricacies of subsystems, making them easier to use and manage.

2. Learn with Analogies
    
    Explanation: Easier to remember. For the Facade pattern, think of it like the front desk of a hotel. Guests interact with the front desk to access a variety of services (room service, housekeeping, concierge) without needing to understand the details of how each service operates. This front desk is your "facade" that simplifies and centralizes communication.

3. Use Mnemonics
  Create a mnemonic to remember the key aspects of the Facade pattern. For example, "FACE the complexity with Simplicity" where each letter could stand for:
  
   Facade class provides...
   Access to...
   Complex subsystems through a...
   Easy to use interface.

A Facade class that provides a simple interface. Various subsystems that perform the underlying complexities. A client that interacts only with the Facade.
